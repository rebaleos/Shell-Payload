# Shell-Payload Scenario needs practical skills in Ethical hacking from HTB academy :


The Live Engagement
Here we are. Itâ€™s the big day and time to start our engagement. We need to put our new skills with crafting and delivering payloads, acquiring and interacting with a shell on Windows and Linux, and how to take over a Web application to the test. Complete the objectives below to finish the engagement.

Scenario:
CAT5's team has secured a foothold into Inlanefrieght's network for us. Our responsibility is to examine the results from the recon that was run, validate any info we deem necessary, research what can be seen, and choose which exploit, payloads, and shells will be used to control the targets. Once on the VPN or from your Pwnbox, we will need to RDP into the foothold host and perform any required actions from there. Below you will find any credentials, IP addresses, and other info that may be required.

Objectives:
Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a Windows host or server.
Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a Linux host or server.
Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a Web application.
Demonstrate your ability to identify the shell environment you have access to as a user on the victim host.
